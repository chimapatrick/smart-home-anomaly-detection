# 🔐 Smart Home Anomaly Detection Using Lightweight AI

## Overview
This project demonstrates a lightweight Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for detecting anomalous behaviour in smart home IoT environments.

Smart homes rely on interconnected devices that continuously exchange data. This connectivity introduces cybersecurity risks such as unauthorized access and abnormal device activity. This project uses a machine learning anomaly detection model to identify suspicious behaviour patterns.

## Objective
To simulate real-time monitoring of IoT device behaviour using a lightweight AI model suitable for resource-constrained smart home environments.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Method
The system uses an **Isolation Forest** algorithm to:
- Learn normal device behaviour
- Detect anomalies in network activity
- Flag suspicious events

## Dataset
A simulated smart home IoT dataset containing:
- Device traffic frequency
- Packet size
- Connection duration

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
 
2. Run the program: python anomaly_detection.py
3. 
## Example Output
The system identifies abnormal device behaviour and visualizes anomalies using graphs.

## Project Purpose
This project supports research in **AI-based smart home security** and demonstrates lightweight anomaly detection suitable for real-time environments.
